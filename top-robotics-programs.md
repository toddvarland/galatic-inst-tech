## Stanford University — Robotics Curriculum Research

### Overview

Stanford University does **not** offer a standalone robotics degree at any level (B.S., M.S., or Ph.D.). Instead, robotics coursework and research are distributed across three departments within the **School of Engineering**:

- **Computer Science (CS)**
- **Mechanical Engineering (ME)**
- **Electrical Engineering (EE)**
- **Aeronautics & Astronautics (AA)** — cross-listed courses

Students pursuing robotics at Stanford typically enroll in a degree program in one of these departments and select robotics-relevant courses as electives or as part of a specialization/concentration.

### Key Research Labs

- **Stanford AI Lab (SAIL)** — Founded in 1963; one of the world's premier AI research centers. The former Stanford Robotics Lab (robotics.stanford.edu) now redirects to SAIL. Key robotics faculty include Oussama Khatib, Jeannette Bohg, Dorsa Sadigh, Chelsea Finn, Marco Pavone, and Shuran Song.
- **Stanford Robotics Center** — Part of the CS department; houses the Interactive Manipulation Lab directed by Oussama Khatib.
- **Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL)** — Directed by Marco Pavone; focuses on autonomous vehicles, robot motion planning, and decision-making under uncertainty.
- **ILIAD Lab** — Directed by Dorsa Sadigh; focuses on interactive and safe autonomy, human-robot interaction.
- **IRIS Lab** — Directed by Jeannette Bohg; focuses on robot manipulation, perception, and interactive learning.
- **PAIR Lab** — Directed by Shuran Song; focuses on perception and robot learning.

### MS CS Specialization: Artificial Intelligence

The CS Master's program offers an **Artificial Intelligence** specialization that explicitly includes **robotics** as a topic area. From Stanford's description:

> *"Artificial Intelligence includes the study of AI principles and techniques... Topics in the AI concentration include knowledge representation and logical reasoning, **robotics**, machine learning, probabilistic modeling and inference, natural language processing, cognition, and applications."*

There is no separate "Robotics" specialization, but the AI specialization accommodates a robotics-focused course plan.

### Key Observations

- **No standalone robotics degree** at any level — students enroll in CSE, EE, or ME and customize their course plan with robotics electives.
- **CSE 478 (Autonomous Robotics)** is the primary undergraduate robotics course, covering state estimation, planning/control, and perception/learning with probabilistic methods.
- **CSE 571 (Probabilistic Robotics)** is the key graduate robotics course, with hands-on robot programming for navigation tasks using Bayes filters and particle filters.
- **E E 347 (Introduction to Robotics and Control Systems)** is a newer EE course dedicated to robotics fundamentals including kinematics, control, sensing, navigation, and path planning — providing a hardware-oriented complement to CSE 478.
- **E E 449 (Robotics and Controls Capstone)** and **CSE 481C (Capstone: Robotics)** provide dedicated robotics capstone experiences in EE and CSE respectively.
- UW's **cross-departmental controls sequence** (E E/A A/M E 547→548→549→550→580→583→585→593→594→597) is one of the most comprehensive jointly-offered control systems curricula in the country, spanning four engineering departments.
- **M E 586 (Biology Inspired Robotics)** and **E E 540 (Wearable Robotics)** provide specialized graduate courses in bio-inspired design and human-assistive robotics.
- **E E 543 (Models of Robot Manipulation)** is a dedicated graduate course on mathematical models of articulated robotic arms — kinematic models, Jacobian matrices, and Newton-Euler dynamics.
- The **Robotics and Control Systems Colloquium** (E E/M E/A A/CHEM E 591) provides a cross-disciplinary seminar series emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of robotics.
- UW's robotics strength is heavily **research-driven** — the six Allen School labs (HCR, Personal Robotics, RSE, Robot Learning, Sensor Systems, WEIRD) cover the full spectrum from manipulation and perception to human-robot interaction and embodied intelligence.
- Unlike Michigan's dedicated Robotics Institute with standalone degrees, UW's approach is more similar to Stanford and Berkeley — robotics is pursued through departmental degree programs with elective course selection and research lab affiliation.

### Key Observations

- **JHU offers one of the few dedicated MSE in Robotics degrees** in the U.S., with six formal specialization tracks — unlike Stanford, Berkeley, and UW where robotics is pursued through departmental degrees with elective selection.
- **Medical robotics is JHU's signature strength.** The Computer Integrated Surgery sequence (EN.601.455/456/655/656), Medical Robotics System Design (EN.530.721), and Magnetically Actuated/MRI Compatible Robots (EN.530.666) form an unparalleled concentration in surgical and medical robotics.
- **EN.530.646 (Robot Devices, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control)** is the primary graduate-level robotics foundations course, serving as a prerequisite for Medical Robotics System Design and other advanced courses.
- **EN.601.463/663 (Algorithms for Sensor-Based Robotics)** is the CS department's core robotics algorithms course, covering kinematics through SLAM in the ROS framework — analogous to CMU's 16-741 or Stanford's CS 223A in scope.
- **EN.530.707 (Robot System Programming)** provides dedicated ROS 2 and Gazebo training — a practical systems course that complements the theoretical foundations courses.
- **EN.601.491/691 (Human-Robot Interaction)** provides HRI-specific coursework, an area of growing importance not always offered as a dedicated course at peer institutions.
- The **LCSR weekly seminar (EN.620.745)** provides cross-pollination across all robotics sub-areas, with speakers from internal and external research groups.
- **PhD students** must enroll through CS, ME, ECE, or BME departments — there is no standalone Robotics PhD, though students work in LCSR labs and attend robotics-specific seminars and courses.
- The **Engineering for Professionals (EP)** track (EN.665) offers part-time/online robotics courses including Capstone Robotic Systems Development with ROS 2, Multi-Robot Systems, and AI for Robotics — making JHU's robotics curriculum accessible to working professionals.
- **Locomotion mechanics** is uniquely well-covered at JHU with a dedicated 3-course sequence (Fundamentals → Recent Advances → Dynamics & Control) — a specialty not matched at most peer institutions.
- The full MSE advising manual with detailed per-track required/elective course lists is available at: https://lcsr.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-2026-Robotics-Advising-Manual-November-2025-1.pdf
- The **Allen School** is the primary hub for robotics research, while the EE and ME departments contribute strong controls, sensing, and mechatronics curricula.
